# Welcome to My GitHub!

ðŸ‘‹ Hi there! I'm VÃ¡leri Calhau, a self-taught coder on an exciting journey of learning and building. I'm thrilled to have you here on my GitHub!

Let me tell you a bit about myself and what you can expect to find here.

## About Me

I haven't always been passionate about coding. It wasn't love at first sight. I was attracted by how different it is to learn coding, and it was only when I was mature enough to dedicate myself to this new tech adventure. Finally, I've embarked on this self-taught journey to explore the world of programming! It's been an incredible journey of growth and personal discovery so far. I love the challenge and the endless possibilities that coding offers.

One of my earliest projects was a website dedicated to my beloved furry companion, TainÃ¡ Amora. She's my best friend with four paws and a wagging tail. Through coding, I wanted to capture our special bond and create something unique. It was a heartwarming experience that sparked my passion for web development.
Check out my [TainaAmoraCodes](https://github.com/valeridev/TainaAmoraCodes) repository to learn more about the project!

## Certificates and Achievements

On my learning journey, I've achieved a handful of certificates that showcase my dedication and progress. I'm proud of these accomplishments, but I consider them just the beginning. There's so much more to learn, build, and achieve!

## Explore My Repositories

I invite you to check out my repositories to see the projects I've been working on. You'll find a mix of personal projects, coding exercises, and experiments. Feel free to explore, provide feedback, or even collaborate on any of the projects. I'm always open to new ideas and collaborations.

Thank you for visiting my GitHub! I'm excited to continue growing as a coder and sharing my journey with you. Don't hesitate to reach out if you have any questions or want to connect.

Happy coding! ðŸš€
